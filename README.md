ðŸš° **Water Potability Classification**

Developed during my Data Science internship at Technex IIT Varanasi, this project a machine learning model is built which predicts if a water sample is drinkable (potable) or not based on its components. I preprocessed and analyzed the data and then built a machine learning model. The selected Random Forest Model has outstanding performance:

[ Accuracy: 78 % ;
Precision: 70 % ;
Recall: 73 % ;
F1-Score: 72 % ;
ROC-AUC: 86 % ]

A powerful model for improving water safety analysis! ðŸ’§
