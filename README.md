ðŸš° **Water Potability Classification**
Developed during my Data Science internship at Technex IIT Varanasi, this project predicts water potability using machine learning. I preprocessed and analyzing data and then built a machine learning model which is able to classify wether a water sample is drinkable or not based on its components. The selected Random Forest Model has outstanding performance:

Accuracy: 78 %
Precision: 70 %
Recall: 73 %
F1-Score: 72 %
ROC-AUC: 86 %

A powerful model for improving water safety analysis! ðŸ’§
