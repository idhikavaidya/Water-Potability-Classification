# Water-Potability-Classification
This project, completed during my Data Science internship with Technex IIT Varanasi, involves developing a machine learning model to predict water potability. The project analyzes preprocessed data and constructs a Random Forest model with impressive performance metrics (Accuracy: 80%, Precision: 80%, Recall: 61%, F1-Score: 70%, ROC-AUC: 99)
